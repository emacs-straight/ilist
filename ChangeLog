	* Now the user can set the variable `ilist-pixel-precision` to
	control whether the package calculates the lengths of strings by
	pixels, which is more accurate but more expensive.

	Since this does almost nothing to users who do not use non-Latin
	letters and is more expensive than the previous algorithms in
	order to correctly measure widths of strings, the user should
	intentionally set this variable to non-nil, should the user want
	to do so.

	Use the built-in function invisible-p to replace a hand-made
	function ilist-invisible-property-p.

	Correct the use of an argument to the macro
	ilist-define-automatic-group.

	Provide a better way to handle the definition of sorters in the
	macro ilist-define-automatic-group.

	Update documentation.

	Also add the options to skip invisible lines to some primitive
